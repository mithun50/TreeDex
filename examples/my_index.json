Is the converse also true? Does an\nelectric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? James Clerk\nMaxwell (1831-1879), argued that this was indeed the case \u2013 not only\nan electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magnetic\nfield. While applying the Ampere\u2019s circuital law to find magnetic field at a\npoint outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell\nnoticed an inconsistency in the Ampere\u2019s circuital law. He suggested the\nexistence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement\ncurrent to remove this inconsistency.\nMaxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic\nfields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These\nequations are known as Maxwell\u2019s equations. Together with the Lorentz\nforce formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws\nof electromagnetism.\nThe most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell\u2019s equations\nis the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time-\nvarying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space.

Maxwell\u2019s work\nthus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and\nlight. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the\nexistence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological use\nby Marconi and others led in due course to the\nrevolution in communication that we are witnessing\ntoday.\nIn this chapter, we first discuss the need for\ndisplacement current and its consequences. Then we\npresent a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves.\nThe broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves,\nstretching from g rays (wavelength ~10\u201312 m) to long\nradio waves (wavelength ~106 m) is described.\n8.2  DISPLACEMENT CURRENT\nWe have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical current\nproduces a magnetic field around it. Maxwell showed\nthat for logical consistency, a changing electric field must\nalso produce a magnetic field. This effect is of great\nimportance because it explains the existence of radio\nwaves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other\nforms of electromagnetic waves.\nTo see how a changing electric field gives rise to\na magnetic field, let us consider the process of\ncharging of a capacitor and apply Ampere\u2019s circuital\nlaw given by (Chapter 4)\n\u201cB.dl = m0 i (t)\n          (8.1)\nto find magnetic  field at a point outside the capacitor.\nFigure 8.1(a)  shows a parallel plate capacitor C which\nis a part of circuit through which a time-dependent\ncurrent i (t) flows . Let us find the magnetic field at a\npoint such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate\ncapacitor.  For this, we consider a plane circular loop of\nradius r whose plane is perpendicular to the direction\nof the current-carrying wire, and which is centred\nsymmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From\nsymmetry, the magnetic field is directed along the\ncircumference of the circular loop and is the same in\nmagnitude at all points on the loop so that if B is the\nmagnitude of the field, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is B (2p r).\nSo we have\nB (2pr) = m0i (t)\n   (8 .2)\nJAMES CLERK MAXWELL (1831\u20131879)\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n(1831 \u2013 1879) Born in\nEdinburgh, Scotland,\nwas among the greatest\nphysicists \nof \nthe\nnineteenth century.

      "text": "203\nElectromagnetic\nWaves\nNow, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. This\nis a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but\nhas its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular\nloop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box\n(without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere\u2019s circuital law to such\nsurfaces with the same perimeter, we find that the left hand side of\nEq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is zero and not m0i,\nsince no current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we\nhave a contradiction; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a\npoint P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.\nSince the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere\u2019s circuital law,\nthis law must be missing something. The missing term must be such\nthat one gets the same magnetic field at point P,  no matter what surface\nis used.\nWe can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at\nFig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between the\nplates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the\ncapacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the\nelectric field E between the plates is (Q/A)/e0 (see Eq. 2.41). The field is\nperpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude\nover the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what\nis the electric flux FE through the surface S ? Using Gauss\u2019s law, it is\nE\n0\n0\n1\n=\n=\nQ\nQ\nA\nA\nA\n\u03a6\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n=\nE\n(8.3)\nNow if the charge Q on the capacitor plates changes with time, there is a\ncurrent i = (dQ/dt), so that using Eq. (8.3), we have\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\n\u03a6E\nt\nt\nQ\nQ\nt\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7=\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n0\n0\n1\nThis implies that for consistency,\n\u03b50\nd\nd\n\u03a6E\nt\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7 = i\n(8.4)\nThis is the missing term in Ampere\u2019s circuital law. If we generalise\nthis law by adding to the total current carried by conductors through\nthe surface, another term which is e0 times the rate of change of electric\nflux through the same surface, the total has the same value of current i\nfor all surfaces. If this is done, there is no contradiction in the value of B\nobtained anywhere using the generalised Ampere\u2019s law. B at the point P\nis non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. B at a\npoint P outside the plates [Fig. 8.1(a)] is the same as at a point M just\ninside, as it should be. The current carried by conductors due to flow of\ncharges is called conduction current. The current, given by Eq. (8.4), is a\nnew term, and is due to changing electric field (or electric displacement,\nan old term still used sometimes). It is, therefore, called displacement\ncurrent or Maxwell\u2019s displacement current. Figure 8.2 shows the electric\nand magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above.\nThe generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following. The source\nof a magnetic field is not just the conduction electric current due to flowing\nFIGURE 8.1 A\nparallel plate\ncapacitor C, as part of\na circuit through\nwhich a time\ndependent current\ni (t) flows,  (a) a loop of\nradius r, to determine\nmagnetic field at a\npoint P on the loop;\n(b) a pot-shaped\nsurface passing\nthrough the interior\nbetween the capacitor\nplates with the loop\nshown in (a) as its\nrim; (c) a tiffin-\nshaped surface with\nthe circular loop as\nits rim and a flat\ncircular bottom S\nbetween the capacitor\nplates.

More\nprecisely, the total current i is the sum of the conduction current\ndenoted by ic, and the displacement current denoted by id (= \u27120\n(d\u2702E/dt)).

On the other hand, inside the capacitor, there is\nno conduction current, i.e., ic = 0, and there is only displacement\ncurrent, so that id = i.\nThe generalised (and correct) Ampere\u2019s circuital law has the same\nform as Eq. (8.1), with one difference: \u201cthe total current passing\nthrough any surface of which the closed loop is the perimeter\u201d is\nthe sum of the conduction current and the displacement current.\nThe generalised law is\nB\nl\ni\n\u00d1\nd =\nd\nd\n0\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n\u03b5\n0\n0\ni\nt\nc\nE\n+\n\u222b\n\u03a6\n(8.6)\nand is known as Ampere-Maxwell law.\nIn all respects, the displacement current has the same physical\neffects as the conduction current. In some cases, for example, steady\nelectric fields in a conducting wire, the displacement current may\nbe zero since the electric field E does not change with time. In other\ncases, for example, the charging capacitor above, both conduction\nand displacement currents may be present in different regions of\nspace. In most of the cases, they both may be present in the same\nregion of space, as there exist no perfectly conducting or perfectly\ninsulating medium. Most interestingly, there may be large regions\nof space where there is no conduction current, but there is only a\ndisplacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such a\nregion, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction)\ncurrent source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement current\ncan be verified experimentally. For example, a magnetic field (say at point\nM) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured and\nis seen to be the same as that just outside (at P).\nThe displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences.\nOne thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and\nmagnetism are now more symmetrical*. Faraday\u2019s law of induction states\nthat there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.\nNow, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit\ncharge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence\nof an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday\u2019s law of electromagnetic\ninduction by saying that a magnetic field, changing with time, gives rise\nto an electric field. Then, the fact that an electric field changing with\ntime gives rise to a magnetic field, is the symmetrical counterpart, and is\nFIGURE 8.2 (a) The\nelectric and magnetic\nfields E and B between\nthe capacitor plates, at\nthe point M.

Neither stationary charges\nnor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of\nelectromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic fields, while\nthe latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time.\nIt is an important result of Maxwell\u2019s theory that accelerated charges\nradiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyond\nthe scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough,\nqualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency.\n(An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.)   This\nproduces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an\noscillating magnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric\nfield, and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus\nregenerate each other, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the\nspace. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the\nfrequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the\npropagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source \u2013 the\naccelerated charge.\nFrom the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the\nprediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. We might think that all\nwe needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate\nat the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is not\npossible. The frequency of yellow light is about 6 \u00d7 1014 Hz, while the\nfrequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about\n1011 Hz.

Two important\nachievements in this connection deserve mention. Seven\nyears after Hertz, Jagdish Chandra Bose, working at\nCalcutta (now Kolkata), succeeded in producing and\nobserving electromagnetic waves of much shorter\nwavelength (25 mm to 5 mm). His experiment, like that\nof Hertz\u2019s, was confined to the laboratory.\nAt around the same time, Guglielmo Marconi in Italy\nfollowed Hertz\u2019s work and succeeded in transmitting\nelectromagnetic waves over distances of many kilometres.\nMarconi\u2019s experiment marks the beginning of the field of\ncommunication using electromagnetic waves.\n8.3.2  Nature of electromagnetic waves\nIt can be shown from Maxwell\u2019s equations that electric\nand magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are\nperpendicular to each other, and to the direction of\npropagation. It appears reasonable, say from our\ndiscussion of the displacement current. Consider\nFig. 8.2. The electric field inside the plates of the capacitor\nis directed perpendicular to the plates. The magnetic\nfield this gives rise to via the displacement current is\nalong the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitor\nplates. So B and E are perpendicular in this case. This\nis a general feature.\nIn Fig. 8.3, we show a typical example of a plane\nelectromagnetic wave propagating along the z direction\n(the fields are shown as a function of the z coordinate, at\na given time t). The electric field Ex is along the x-axis,\nand varies sinusoidally with z, at a given time. The\nmagnetic field By is along the y-axis, and again varies\nsinusoidally with z. The electric and magnetic fields Ex\nand By are perpendicular to each\nother, and to the direction z of\npropagation. We can write Ex and\nBy as follows:\nEx= E0 sin (kz\u2013wt)\n[8.7(a)]\nBy= B0 sin (kz\u2013wt)\n[8.7(b)]\nHere k is related to the wave length\nl of the wave by the usual\nequation\n2\nk\n\u03bb\n\u03c0\n=\n(8.8)\n EXAMPLE 8.1\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz\n(1857 \u2013 1894) German\nphysicist who was the\nfirst to broadcast and\nreceive radio waves.

This relation is often written\nin terms of frequency, \u03bd (=\u03c9/2\u03c0) and wavelength, \u03bb (=2\u03c0/k) as\n2\n2\n\u03c0\u03bd\n\u03bb\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nc\n\u03c0\n   or\n\u03bd\u03bb = c\n[8.9(b)]\nIt is also seen from Maxwell\u2019s equations that the magnitude of the\nelectric and the magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are related as\nB0 = (E0/c)\n(8.10)\nWe here make remarks on some features of electromagnetic waves.\nThey are self-sustaining oscillations of electric and magnetic fields in\nfree space, or vacuum. They differ from all the other waves we have\nstudied so far, in respect that no material medium is involved in the\nvibrations of the electric and magnetic fields.\nBut what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light,\nan electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We\nhave seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a\nmedium are described in terms of a permittivity \u03b5 and a magnetic\npermeability \u00b5 (these describe the factors  by which the total fields differ\nfrom the external fields). These replace \u03b50 and \u00b50 in the description to\nelectric and magnetic fields in Maxwell\u2019s equations with the result that in\na material medium of permittivity \u03b5 and magnetic permeability \u00b5, the\nvelocity of light becomes,\n1\nv\n\u00b5\u03b5\n=\n(8.11)\nThus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of\nthe medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index of\none medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of\nlight in the two media.\nThe velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an\nimportant fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on\nelectromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the\nsame (independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, out\nof a value of 3\u00d7108 m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves in\nvacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is\nso well known now that this is used to define a standard of length.\nThe great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems\nfrom their capability to carry energy from one place to another. The\nradio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. Light\ncarries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible on\nthe earth.\nReprint 2025-26\n",

The existence\nof ultraviolet and infrared waves was barely established. By the end of the\nnineteenth century, X-rays and gamma rays had also been discovered.  We\nnow know that, electromagnetic waves include visible light waves, X-rays,\ngamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet and infrared waves. The\nclassification of em waves according to frequency is the electromagnetic\nspectrum (Fig. 8.4). There is no sharp division between one kind of wave\nand the next. The classification is based roughly on how the waves are\nproduced and/or detected.\nWe briefly describe these different types of electromagnetic waves, in\norder of decreasing wavelengths.\nElectromagnetic spectrum\nhttp://www.fnal.gov/pub/inquiring/more/light\nhttp://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/\nReprint 2025-26\n",

They are used in radio and television communication systems. They\nare generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHz.\nThe AM (amplitude modulated) band is from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. Higher\nfrequencies upto 54 MHz are used for short wave bands. TV waves range\nfrom 54 MHz to 890 MHz. The FM (frequency modulated) radio band\nextends from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. Cellular phones use radio waves to\ntransmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band.

Due to their short wavelengths,\nthey are suitable for the radar systems used in aircraft navigation.

This band\nlies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible\nspectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves. This\nis because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb\ninfrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO2, NH3, also absorb\ninfrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is,\nthey heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in\nphysical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in\nmaintaining the earth\u2019s warmth or average temperature through the\ngreenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily\nthrough the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth\u2019s surface and re-\nradiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is\ntrapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour.\nInfrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes\nand to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example\nsemiconductor light emitting diodes) also   emit infrared and are widely\nused in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV\nsets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.\n8.4.4 Visible rays\nIt is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves. It is the part of the\nspectrum that is detected by the human eye. It runs from about\n4 \u00d7 1014 Hz to about 7 \u00d7 1014\n Hz or a wavelength range of about 700 \u2013\n400 nm. Visible light emitted or reflected from objects around us provides\nus information about the world. Our eyes are sensitive to this range of\nwavelengths. Different animals are sensitive to different range of\nwavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the\n\u2018visible\u2019 range of many insects extends well into the utraviolet.\n8.4.5 Ultraviolet rays\nIt covers wavelengths ranging from about 4 \u00d7 10\u20137 m (400 nm) down to\n6 \u00d7 10\u201310m (0.6 nm). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is produced by special\nlamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultraviolet\nlight. But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in the\natmosphere at an altitude of about 40 \u2013 50 km. UV light in large quantities\nhas harmful effects on humans. Exposure to UV radiation induces the\nproduction of more melanin, causing tanning of the skin. UV radiation is\nabsorbed by ordinary glass. Hence, one cannot get tanned or sunburn\nthrough glass windows.\nWelders wear special glass goggles or face masks with glass windows\nto protect their eyes from large amount of UV produced by welding arcs.\nDue to its  shorter wavelengths, UV radiations  can be focussed into very\nnarrow beams for high precision applications such as  LASIK (Laser-\nassisted in situ keratomileusis) eye surgery. UV lamps are used to kill\ngerms  in water purifiers.\nOzone layer in the atmosphere plays a protective role, and hence its\ndepletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gas (such as freon) is a matter\nof international concern.\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Consequently, the waves differ\nconsiderably in their mode of interaction with matter.\n2.\nAccelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The\nwavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the\ncharacteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation,\nhaving wavelength of 10\u201314 m to 10\u201315 m, typically originate from an\natomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves\nare produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting\nantenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of\nabout the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms\nis, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size.\n3.\nInfrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light,\nvibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules of a\nsubstance. This vibration increases the internal energy and\nconsequently, the temperature of the substance. This is why infrared\nwaves are often called heat waves.\n4.\nThe centre of sensitivity of our eyes coincides with the centre of the\nwavelength distribution of the sun. It is because humans have evolved\nwith visions most sensitive to the strongest wavelengths from\nthe sun.\nEXERCISES\n8.1\nFigure 8.5 shows a capacitor made of two circular plates each of\nradius 12 cm, and separated by 5.0 cm.
